## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main FastAPI application file.
- `models.py`: Database models (SQLAlchemy).
- `schemas.py`: Validation schemas (Pydantic).
- `database.py`: SQLite database configuration.
- `routers/`: Directory with route files (students, courses, enrollments).
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies list.

---

- The SQLite database will be automatically created as `escola.db` on the first run.
- To reset the database, simply delete the `escola.db` file (this will erase all data).
